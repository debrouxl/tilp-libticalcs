Log of changes (libticalcs):

- 31/03/2013, version 1.1.8: debrouxl
	- fix off-by-one in calc_84p.c::get_version(), which led to the last character of the product ID being cut off. Reported by ParkeR.
	- advertise ROM dumping support in CalcFncts calc_84p_usb.
	- regenerate with Autoconf 2.69 and Automake 1.11.5.
	- suppress name clashes between dusb_rpkt.h / nsp_rpkt.h and dusb_vpkt.h / nsp_vpkt.h.
	- export dbus_recv, dbus_send, dusb_recv, dusb_send, nsp_recv and nsp_send, i.e. provide to external users the ability to send and receive raw packets.
	- protect {dbus,dusb,nsp}_{recv,send} against NULL parameters.
	- add "torture test" programs for testing how functions of the public API react to NULL parameters.
	- fix several malloc/realloc/free vs. g_malloc/g_malloc0/g_free mismatches.
	- move a number of internal definitions to a new "internal.h" header; add several traces.
	- rename a bunch of internal functions, and remove the corresponding internal macros.
	- TI-68k ROM dumpers: remove redundant definitions of uint8_t, uint16_t and uint32_t.
	- integrate tf2hex and the ROM dumpers into the autotools chain, by Benjamin Moody.
	- add variable rename and variable attribute change functions, by Benjamin Moody; improve test_ticalcs_2; several drive-by fixes and improvements.
	- DUSB / NSP: kill more NULL dereferences by sanitizing function arguments; get rid of a number of TRYF; add a DUSB error code.
	- a fix for dusb_cmd, and an improvement to test_ticalcs_2.
	- integrate a couple fixes to the 84+ DUSB ROM dumper by Benjamin Moody, and switch the source code and building process of that ROM dumper from tasm to spasm.
	- integrate new TI-Z80 ROM dumper (with, among others, the ability to automatically dump 82 and 85, and the ability to unlock 73/83+/84+ Flash memory without an OS patch), and other ROM dumping improvements, by Benjamin Moody.
	- integrate the TI-68k ROM dumpers into the automake definitions, and optimize them in the process.
	- regenerate with Automake 1.11.6.
	- use LF line endings throughout the sources.
	- add initial, experimental TI-80 VSC support, by Randy Compton.
	- convert README to UTF-8.
	- add a Nspire error code related to OS extensions on OS versions which do not support them; add OS sending to test_ticalcs_2.
	- fix some spelling errors (or at least, infrequent forms) reported by Lintian (through Albert "alberthro" Huang) and rpmlint (through TC01).
	- fixes for i18n problems reported by Benjamin Moody.
	- in order to promote code reuse by external users of the library (instead of copy-paste), export functions from nsp_cmd and nsp_vpkt into the public API (though backwards compatibility will not necessarily be maintained strongly).
	- install keys83.h and keys86.h alongside the other headers.
	- add Nspire remote control feature, to mirror functionality exposed by TI's code and used by nRemote. Showcase it in test_ticalcs_2.
	- expand torture tests, and perform minor fixes.
	- update "counters" arrays in CalcFncts instances. They have been broken for years, since the DUMP_ROM -> DUMP_ROM1 + DUMP_ROM2 change, or the addition of EXECUTE, whichever occurred first.
	- in 84+ DUSB ROM dumper, enable UnlockFlash, so that the certificate page can be dumped.
	- test_ticalcs_2: in send_var(), add the ability to define the file name, if the target calculator is Nspire.
	- fix a number of problems related to unaligned reads/writes and left shifts of count >= width of type; fix more compiler warnings reported by clang.
	- fix more compiler warnings reported (or made more visible) by clang.
	- add 83+ family DBUS memory dump command; while at it, reformat, harden and export functions from cmd73.c.
	- when communicating with 84+ through DUSB, allow variables with the same name but different types. Patch by Benjamin Moody. Additionally, add a couple debugging traces in test_ticalcs_2.
	- add known 84+CSE hardware version, and plausible default model for unknown hardware versions. Reported by Benjamin Moody.
	- add prefixes to a number of functions and struct names, and adjust callers.
	- export dusb_vpkt functions and header, add torture test.
	- temporary kludge for sending 84+CSE Pic files. Patch by Benjamin Moody.
	- export dbus_cmd functions, add torture tests for dusb_cmd functions.
	- add several known command DBUS IDs (documented by Benjamin Moody and Brandon Wilson), this patch mostly by Jon Sturm.
	- nsp_cmd: add the 0x06 command, whose externally visible effect is to trigger a dialog whose title is "Transfers complete" and text is "All files have been transferred".

- 14/12/2011, version 1.1.7: debrouxl
	- add error code returned by the Nspire when the anti-downgrade protection refuses an OS version older than the configured minimum version.

	- if we're talking to a 73, don't try to test for 83+SE. The oldest 73 OS versions don't support get_version. Reported by Benjamin Moody, fix discussed by Lionel and Benjamin.
	- add error code returned by DUSB protocol calcs when refusing a FlashApp whose signature does not match. Reported by Albert H.
	- upgrade version of gettext to 0.17, released in late 2007.

	New function added: ticalc_83p_89_92p_isready. Allow to auto-detect a 
	TI83+/89/92+ calculator.
	This function is cleaner than ti89_92_92p_isready and should be used 
	as a replacement even if it does not check for a TI92 any longer.

	for this case
	ti89_waitdata() improved.
	Error codes changed (valued).
	
- 19/12/2001, version 2.1.1:
